# Car Black Box Project

## Description
The **Car Black Box** project is designed to monitor and log key car parameters such as speed, engine status, and time. It acts as a real-time monitoring system for vehicles, providing insights into the car's operation and helping track performance, including logging the time of events and conditions.

The system is based on an embedded architecture with features like alert generation for abnormal conditions (e.g., high speed) and allows for local data monitoring.

## Features
- **Real-time vehicle data monitoring**: Monitors car parameters such as speed, engine status, and time.
- **Time Logging**: Logs and displays the time of key events (e.g., when certain conditions are met).
- **Alert System**: Sends alerts (via LCD or other means) if any critical threshold is crossed (e.g., speed).
- **LCD Display**: Displays real-time information on an LCD screen inside the car.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **MPLAB X IDE**: The primary IDE for developing and compiling the code.
- **Microchip XC8 Compiler**: For compiling the embedded code for PIC microcontrollers.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KSTharun19/car-black-box-project.git
